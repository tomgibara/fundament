This small Java library provides a minimal set of unifying abstractions for packages under the `com.tomgibara` namespace. To the extent that the library is useful in other projects it may be introduced with the following Maven dependency:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.tomgibara.fundament</groupId>
  <artifactId>fundament</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
